# gotyno-web-server

This is meant to be a test bed for different Gotyno outputs to interact with
each other. The first implemented test is TS running as a server with Python
talking to it. This is done to ensure that output and assumptions remain
consistent across languages.

The Python client code can be found in `clients/python/src/client.py`.
